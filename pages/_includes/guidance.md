## Intent of this Implementation Guide
This implementation guide describes how to access the FHIR interface to the NHI. 

This is primarily a read-only interface, though there is an operation that allows the address to be updated by an authorized user.



If you wish to make comments about the Patient profile that describes the response from the NHI query then the information model that describes this profile can be found from the [project launch page](http://nz.clinfhir.com)

>Technically, the Information model is automatically transformed into the Profile so is the 'source of truth'. It's easier to read than the profile (especially for exploring the valuesets), and has the capability for making comments - but the profile is the 'technically correct' version for an implementer.

## Specific notes
### Gender
In New Zeakand there is a [standard](http://nz.clinfhir.com) for gender
